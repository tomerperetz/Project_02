Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you
'Cause I got what they got I am talking times two
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seeing right through
