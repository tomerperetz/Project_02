Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down love street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-dependant?
Oh no
Bump, bump
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear but
The way we make out
When I was an all-aloner
Nothing but a two-beach comber
Anybody seen the sky, I'm
I'm wide awake now!
Workin' the beat as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-dependant?
